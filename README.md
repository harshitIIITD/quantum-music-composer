# quantum-music-composer

## Project Description
This repository contains code for generating music using quantum circuits. The project leverages quantum computing to create unique musical compositions by encoding musical notes and rhythms into quantum circuits.

## Installation Instructions
To set up the environment and install the necessary dependencies, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/harshitIIITD/quantum-music-composer.git
   cd quantum-music-composer
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage Instructions
To generate music using the provided Jupyter notebook, follow these steps:

1. Start Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

2. Open the `new.ipynb` notebook and run all the cells to generate a MIDI file with the composed music.
